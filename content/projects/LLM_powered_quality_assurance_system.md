# Building an LLM-powered Quality Assurance System

At **Deepmindz Innovations**, we built an **AI-driven quality assurance tool** to automate call center evaluations — replacing manual scoring with real-time analytics powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## Problem
Quality assurance teams in call centers spend hours listening to calls and manually filling evaluation forms. The objective was to automate this process with AI while maintaining high accuracy.

## Solution
- Designed a **FastAPI-based backend** to handle streaming audio and text data  
- Implemented **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual accuracy  
- Used **LangChain** and **OpenAI models** for semantic understanding of call transcripts  
- Integrated PostgreSQL and caching for scalable data access  

## Impact
- Reduced evaluation time **from 4 minutes to 8 seconds per call**  
- Achieved a **3× improvement in productivity**  
- Enabled consistent and explainable AI-based call scoring  

This project proved how language models can augment enterprise workflows and deliver measurable business impact.
