# Engineering the Backend for a Digital Health Platform

As part of a project under India’s **National Health Mission**, I developed the backend for a large-scale **digital health application** designed to improve healthcare accessibility and data efficiency.

## Overview
The platform connects health workers, administrators, and citizens through centralized dashboards and analytics. Scalability and speed were key challenges due to massive data inflows.

## Core Work
- Developed RESTful APIs in **Python (FastAPI)**  
- Created **MongoDB aggregation pipelines** for large health datasets  
- Integrated **React dashboards** for reporting and visualization  
- Reduced data query latency from **18 seconds to 400ms** using optimized indexing and caching  

## Outcome
The platform handled concurrent user loads efficiently and drastically improved data access speed for field workers and administrators alike.

This project reinforced the value of clean architecture and database tuning in high-impact public health systems.
